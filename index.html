  <p id='gh'>Metallica (commonly known as The Black Album) is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica,
    released on August 12, 1991[6] through Elektra Records. It was recorded in an eight-month span at One on One
    Recording Studios in Los Angeles. The recording of the album was troubled, however, and, during production, the band
    frequently came into conflict with their new producer, Bob Rock. The album marked a change in the band's sound from
    the thrash metal style of the previous four albums to a slower and heavier one rooted in heavy metal. </p>

    <p id='r'> promoted Metallica with a series of tours. They also released five singles to promote the album: "Enter
    Sandman", "The Unforgiven", "Nothing Else Matters", "Wherever I May Roam", and "Sad but True", all of which have
    been considered to be among the band's best-known songs. The song "Don't Tread on Me" was also issued to rock radio
    shortly after the album's release but did not receive a commercial single release.</p> 

    <p id='r'> Metallica received widespread critical acclaim and became the band's best-selling album. It debuted at number one in
    ten countries and spent four consecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard 200, making it Metallica's first album to
    top the album charts. Metallica is one of the best-selling albums worldwide, and also one of the best-selling albums
    in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began. The album was certified 16Ã— platinum by the Recording
    Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012, and has sold over sixteen million copies in the United States, being
    the first album in the SoundScan era to do so.</p> 

    <p id="r"> Metallica played Metallica in its entirety during the 2012 European Black Album Tour. In 2003, the album was ranked
    number 255 on Rolling Stone's 500 greatest albums of all time. In December 2019, Metallica became the fourth release
    in American history to enter the 550-week milestone on the Billboard 200. It also became the second longest-charting
    traditional title in history, and the second to spend 550 weeks on the album charts.[7]</p>
